The Smart Home Network  is an interactive system that allows users to monitor and control various smart home devices from a centralized interface. This project uses TCP and UDP protocols to manage device communication, enabling real-time monitoring and control of devices such as lights, thermostat, and security systems. The dashboard provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) developed using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter, allowing users to toggle device states, receive smart alerts, and track energy usage.

The project is structured with a client-server architecture:
- Server: A Python-based server that listens for incoming TCP and UDP connections to process device commands.
- Client: A responsive GUI dashboard that sends commands and receives device updates from the server.

Features:
- Device Control: Turn devices on/off and adjust settings using TCP for secure command transmission and UDP for real-time updates.
- Smart Alerts: Receive alerts for significant events, such as temperature thresholds or unusual usage patterns.
- Energy and Usage Monitoring: Track energy consumption and usage statistics for each device.

Technologies Used:
- Python: For server, client, and device logic.
- Socket Programming: To handle TCP/UDP communication.
- Tkinter: To build an interactive GUI for the dashboard.

This project serves as an efficient and scalable solution for modern smart homes, emphasizing ease of control, customization, and enhanced user experience.
